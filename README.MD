# Add functionality to distinguish the section in view
In the second section in js file, I actullay didn't know how to do it and this why i left the first i did with as a comment.
So i did some research between watching videos and dcoumentation.

# Add the functionality to scroll to sections
In the third section in js file, It was easy to do except "scrollIntoView". i had to do some research to know how to do it.
There's an easier way to do scroll behavior by applying "scroll-behavior: smooth" in css file.
